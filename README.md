# Python from Zero

파이썬을 완전 처음부터 배우면서 실행한 기록입니다.

## Progress Log
	•	Day 1: Terminal usage, ran the first Python file
	•	Day 2: Accumulating results in a file, repeated execution
	•	Day 3: Understanding code structure and keeping notes
	•	Day 4: Created first public GitHub repository, file read/write, difference between "w" and "a", learned \n line breaks
	•	Day 5: Connecting for loops with file writing
	•	Day 6: Writing code without reference, intentionally creating and fixing errors, first clean Git commit
	•	Day 7: Memorizing file-writing code, understanding repository structure
	•	Day 8: Using input(), understanding the need for int(), learning the difference between = and ==
	•	Day 9: Understanding if logic and practicing comparison operators
	•	Day 10: Understanding count variables, loop + condition + accumulation structure
	•	Day 11: Writing an even number counter, understanding the % operator
	•	Day 12: Writing a positive number sum program, understanding the importance of indentation
	•	Day 13: Implementing even/odd sum calculation using loops and conditionals
	•	Day 14: Classifying positive, negative, and zero values using loops and conditionals
	•	Day 15: Extending loops, adding zero-termination condition, total/average calculation, managing V1/V2 versions
	•	Day 16: Reimplemented all Day15 tasks from scratch and reviewed average calculation logic


Still a beginner, but I only record what I have actually built and executed.

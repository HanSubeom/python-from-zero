# Python from Zero

파이썬을 완전 처음부터 배우면서 실행한 기록입니다.

## Progress Log
	-	Day 1: Terminal basics, first Python file execution
	-	Day 2: Accumulating results in files, loop execution
	-	Day 3: Understanding code structure, starting Notion notes
	-	Day 4: Creating first public GitHub repository, file read/write, understanding "w" vs "a", learning newline (\n)
	-	Day 5: Connecting for loops with file writing
	-	Day 6: Writing code without reference, intentionally making and fixing errors, first successful Git commit
	-	Day 7: Practicing file writing from memory, understanding repository structure
	-	Day 8: Using input(), understanding why int() conversion is needed, learning = vs ==
	-	Day 9: Logical understanding of if conditions, comparison operator practice
	-	Day 10: Understanding count variables, loop + condition + accumulation structure
	-	Day 11: Building an even number counter, understanding modulo (%) operator
	-	Day 12: Writing a positive number sum program, understanding the importance of accumulation placement (indentation)
	-	Day 13: Implementing even/odd sum using loops and conditionals
	-	Day 14: Classifying positive, negative, and zero values using loops and conditionals
	-	Day 15: Extending loop logic, adding zero-termination condition, total/average calculation, V1/V2 version management
	-	Day 16: Re-implementing all Day15 tasks from scratch and reviewing average calculation logic
	-   Day 17: mastered break/continue control flow and implemented odd-number filter program
	-	Day 18: git rename practice and rebuild master file
	-   Day 19: reinforced flow control logic and validated break/continue behavior

Still a beginner, but I only record what I have actually built and executed.
